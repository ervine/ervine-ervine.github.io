**不是我的节操没了**

It seemed a few long week that I had to push myself to rush dozens of things.
There was a autumn semester final test.
There was a English persatation.
There is a experiment to help and the MATLAB code I have to review and learn.

In fact, I just realize that although I had planned for my daliy life and schedule,
a few unplanned thing can distrusted my rhythm and crack me down.
Last time I mentioned I had spent a lot of time on shopping day
but fail to save a lot of money
and I had felt anxious during the time when waiting for the express delivery.
All this together makes me consider if I have weak power to control my mood,
because it seems that 
when I get a little more work to meet the deadline,
I would fuxk up the schedule and waste time to entertain myself,
trying to "relax myself" (actually I think I'm trying to run out of pressure);
when I get a little new thing,
it would take most of my attention, linger in my head all day.

There is a saying： Not pleased by external gains, not saddened by personnal losses.
I used to think nothing of it, but now I do understand how the surrouding affect our mind.
