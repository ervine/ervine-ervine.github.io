**不是我的节操没了**

It seemed a few long weeks that I had to push myself to rush dozens of things.
There was an autumn semester final test.
There was an English presentation.
There was an experiment to help and the MATLAB code I have to review and learn.

In fact, I just realize that although I had planned for my daily life and schedule,
a few unplanned things can distrusted my rhythm and crack me down.
Last time I mentioned I had spent a lot of time on shopping day
but fail to save a lot of money
and I had felt anxious during the time when waiting for the express delivery.
All this together makes me consider if I have weak power to control my mood,
because it seems that 
when I get a little more work to meet the deadline,
I would fuxk up the schedule and waste time to entertain myself,
trying to "relax myself" (actually I think I'm trying to run out of pressure);
when I get a little new thing,
it would take most of my attention, linger in my head all day.

There is a saying： Not pleased by external gains, not saddened by personal losses.
I used to think nothing of it, but now I do understand how the surrounding affect our mind.
