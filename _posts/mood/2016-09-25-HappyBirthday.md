Today will be the day I never forget.
Not because it's my birthday, but it's the day I stepped out to help others. 

It was in the morning when I rode my bicycle to the office.
I saw a girl fixing her bike on the side of the road.
I just gave it a glance and kept moving forward.
Well, at first I thought that fixing bike was kind of a dirty work and the girl was not that much beautiful.
It was none of my business. But after a few second, my conscience pulled me back.
It was such a shame for me to think like that.
I turned around my bike, and went back to ask the girl if she need help.
Of course she did need help. Actually it turned out it was a easy case and I ended up in less than a minute. 

I have seldom helped any stranger, until today.
Wow, this was the feeling of helping others without any personal attempt and asking for anything.
It will be the the most meaningful birthday in my life!
