There is a sad true that we people always forget the details of fact. As one of the results, when we find out we lost something precious immediately, we feel more upset than when we find out a lot later after forgetting most details of the things we lost. Half year ago I destroy my photos taken when I graduated by mistake. I released when I thought my friend who took photos for me that day had a backup in his SD card, and asked him to send me the photos again. However, we were always in bad timing and delayed getting this thing done again and again. Tonight, I was finally told I lost my photos for sure. At this moment, I'm so upset. But what's more, I'm sad about I just forgot how to feel how the photos and the memory are so precious to me. I don't know why I don't get unhappy like I lost my iPad changer at New Year holiday.

All I can do is tell myself: there is nothing I can fix this and I should appreciate I still have the photos with my best friends and family. All I can do in the further is to cherish the friends I have AND ALWAYS BE ON CLOUD!!!


这个过年真是十分的郁闷。

大除夕就丢敬业幅！！心情很不好。

丢iPad充电器，也郁闷了好几天。（虚惊一场）

一个月连续打卡挑战最后几天没能完成丢虚拟币！！！很不开心！！

回杭州发现忘记带很多东西！！！！怎么做的备忘录的啊我！！！！！

今晚被告知一直想找回来的毕业照没戏了！我心情却很平静。好可怕。
