One thing I have found today(yesterday technically)
is that many girls/classmates I used to like or they used to like me(don't judge me by this...)
now have their own boyfriend when I have been a bachelor for about three years. 
Although I want to have one girlfriend, 
but I don't want to be in the relationship with the girl I just have a little feeling and think it has no future, 
let alone if the girl like me. 
But anyway, I wish every friends I know would have a happy life, and I should not dwell on the old day and "if" fantasy.

I away tell people to "let it go and look forward", 
but when I see they break through the obstacles, 
I realize I'm the one who scare to face the future. 
I'm  really glad for them. 
Wish we all have the courage to be ourselves.
