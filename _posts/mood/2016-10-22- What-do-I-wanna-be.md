A friend came and visited me in HZ.
He just finished Master degree in UK and is going to work in there instead of China.
Besides, his girlfriend is planning to accompany him and study for a higher degree.
So, I think it's the best result for them.
And I'm jealous of him.

After having the paper submitted and receiving a scholarship at ZJU,
I began to consider the best way I want to go - to work or to continue studying.
I prefer the later path, as I really do love studying and researching and experimenting.
The Maths, the physics, and the computer programing, all the scientific stuffs make me exciting.
But I have to make sure the most important thing - whether I'm fit to do research by myself?
Do I have the ability to handle the new environment and independence?
If I do want to take the chance, then I should go for it with all my force.

If I do, I will make my own way without following any others' path.
