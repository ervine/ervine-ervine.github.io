Technically speaking, 
I have nothing done in the last two months. 
Experiments and being boring at home only give me a lesson to work harder. 


Yes, indeed I have enough excuses to explain the failure but these don't give me a second chance in my life to achieve my goal.


I have choose one path to success, 
and I must endeavour and spare no effect to go for it!! 
No way out.
